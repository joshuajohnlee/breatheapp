Breathing app

The breathe app is intended to act as a visual guide to allow users to breathe along to an animated shape. It also features an audio player with different relaxing sounds.

The app uses only HTML/CSS/JS, is written from the ground up, and does not depend on external libraries. I used this project as a way to test what I could do with just my knowlege of HTML/CSS/JS.
